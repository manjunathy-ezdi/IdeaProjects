When spring-session is configured and spring-security is NOT configured.

Tried without x-auth-token. Worked fine. Because no authentication.

Tried with valid x-auth-token (which was present in redis and worked for other microservices which used the same jdbc authentication).
The following error cropped up:
{
  "timestamp": 1456932067842,
  "status": 500,
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "exception": "org.springframework.data.redis.serializer.SerializationException",
  "message": "Cannot deserialize; nested exception is org.springframework.core.serializer.support.SerializationFailedException: Failed to deserialize payload. Is the byte array a result of corresponding serialization for DefaultDeserializer?; nested exception is org.springframework.core.NestedIOException: Failed to deserialize object type; nested exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextImpl",
  "path": "/student"
}

x-auth-token works fine if authentication layer is present with the same type of authentication.
